# thredo

Thredo is threads on async.  For the brave. Or the foolish. Only time will tell.

Note: Thredo requires the most up-to-date version of Curio--meaning the one
that is checked out of the Curio GitHub repository at https://github.com/dabeaz/curio.

## High Level Overview (The Big Idea)

Consider the following thread program involving a worker, a producer,
and queue::

    import threading
    import queue
    import time

    def worker(q):
        while True:
            item = q.get()
            if item is None:
                break
            print('Got:', item)

    def main():
        q = queue.Queue()
        t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(q,))
        t.start()
        for n in range(10):
            q.put(n)
            time.sleep(1)
        q.put(None)
        t.join()

    main()

In this code, there are blocking operations such as ``q.get()`` and
``time.sleep()``.  This blocking is ultimately handled by the
host operating system.  Because of that, it is very difficult for
Python to do anything related to the actual control or scheduling
of threads.  Once blocked, a thread stays blocked forever or until
some event occurs that causes it to unblock.

Thredo re-envisions threads by redirecting all blocking operations to
an async library.  The code looks mostly the same except that you use 
the `thredo` module. For example:

    import thredo

    def worker(q):
        while True:
            item = q.get()
            if item is None:
                break
            print('Got:', item)

    def main():
        q = thredo.Queue()
        t = thredo.spawn(worker, q)
        for n in range(10):
            q.put(n)
            thredo.sleep(1)
        q.put(None)
        t.join()

    thredo.run(main)

The main reason you'd use ``thredo`` however is that it gives you extra
features such as thread groups, cancellation, and more.   For example,
here's a more advanced version of the above code::

    import thredo

    def worker(q):
        try:
            while True:
                item = q.get()
                print('Got:', item)
                q.task_done()
        except thredo.ThreadCancelled:
            print('Worker cancelled')

    def main():
        q = thredo.Queue()
        with thredo.ThreadGroup(wait=None) as workers:
            for n in range(4):
                workers.spawn(worker, q)

            for n in range(10):
                q.put(n)
                thredo.sleep(1)

            q.join()    

    thredo.run(main)

## FAQ

**Q: Is this going to turn into a full-fledged project?**

A: It's too early to say.

**Q: Isn't this sort of like using concurrent.futures?**

A: No. concurrent.futures provides no mechanism for controlling threads and no mechanism for
cancelling threads.  Although it might appear like this is so, given that you can seemingly
"cancel" a Future, this has no effect on thread execution. Once started, worked submitted to a
thread pool in concurrent.futures runs to completion regardless of whether or not the associated Future
is cancelled. Cancelling a future really only causes it to be abandoned if it hasn't yet started.
If you cancel a thread in thredo, it is cleanly cancelled at the next blocking operation.

**Q: Are Thredo Threads real Threads?**

A: Yes. All threads are created using ``threading.Thread``. They run
concurrently according to the same rules as normal threads and can use
all of the objects normally associated with threads (including
synchronization primitives in ``threading``).  If you want to use
things like thread-cancellation however, you need to make sure you use
various objects provided in the ``thredo`` module.  For example,
waiting on a ``thredo.Lock`` can be cancelled whereas waiting on a
``threading.Lock`` can not.
